Includes the entire Native Development Kit (NDK), a set of headers for building native applications for Windows NT4 all the way to Windows Server 2008.

Also includes some sample source code, such as the Native Command Line (NCLI), a command prompt clone written with the NDK and NDL to showcase some functionality of the toolkit, as well as to provide a way to boot Windows without any GUI or subsystems loaded and still be able to interact with the system.
